## Challenges Faced

Despite significant progress, the project is yet to achieve its Minimum Viable Product (MVP) due to the following challenges:

- **Health Issues**: Illness during the development process hindered consistent progress.
- **Technical Issues**: A critical computer breakdown delayed key development milestones.

These setbacks have impacted the project timeline but have not diminished my commitment to delivering a high-quality platform. I am actively working to overcome these challenges and complete the MVP as soon as possible.
